# Watchdog tests

To reduce the effect of other variables like battery level on the collection
of this data, the runs of watchdog enabled and watchdog disabled were alternated.

For many of the runs with the watchdog disabled, the robot did not drive
straight ahead. Rather than estimating the distance that it travelled along
a curve, I instead opted to measure the straight line distance. Therefore,
measurements of the watchdog disabled should be regarded as minimums. On runs
where the robot drove straight, it consistently drove between 16 and 17 feet
(192-204 inches). 

For the watchdog enabled measurements (0"-20") I measured to the nearest inch.
For the watchdog disabled measurements (10 feet or more), I measured to the
nearest half foot.
